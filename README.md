# W3-TheBand
## Overview
Web <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_band.htm">The Band</a> is made by W3Schools.
This is what i have learnt in <a href="https://fullstack.edu.vn/courses/html-css">F8</a>'s HTML-CSS course.

## Installation
* Download index.html and assets folder
* Or clone the repo

## How to get it running
* Open your IDE and go to where you download the index.html and assets folder (must be in the same folder as the index.html file)
* (VSCODE) If you have installed <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a>, there should be a "Live" button on the bottom right corner of the screen, click it and wait for the magic to happen.
* By now, you should have a fully functional web!!!

## Known issues
* It's not polished and may not entirely loo like the original web page

## Feedbacks
If you happen to have feedbacs, please feel free to give me recommendations on how i can improve my html-css-javascript skills.
Thank you for your time...
