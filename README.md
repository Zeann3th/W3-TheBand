## ðŸ“ŒOverview
Web <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_band.htm">The Band</a> is made by W3Schools.
This is what i have learnt in <a href="https://fullstack.edu.vn/courses/html-css">F8</a>'s HTML-CSS course.

## ðŸ”¨Installation
* Download `index.html` and `assets` folder (Or just download from `Releases` on GitHub).
* Clone the repo.

## ðŸš€How to get it running
1. Open your IDE and go to where you downloaded the source code.
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure `index.html` and `assets` folder are on the same directory.

>[!NOTE]
>Don't have an IDE yet? Install Vsual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)!
2. If you have installed <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a>, there should be a "Go Live" button on the bottom right corner of the screen, click it and wait for the browser to open.
3. By now, you should have a fully functional web!!!

## :x:Known issues
* It's not polished and may not entirely look like the original web page.
